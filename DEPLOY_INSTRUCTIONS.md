# 🚀 Deploy Your Website - Complete Guide

## Step 1: Set Up Contact Form (IMPORTANT!)

Before deploying, you need to set up Formspree to receive emails:

1. **Go to**: https://formspree.io
2. **Sign up** (free account - use your email: heetprajapati2401@gmail.com)
3. **Create a new form** - you'll get a form ID like: `xrgkqyzw`
4. **Open** `index.html` in your project
5. **Find this line** (around line 150):
   ```html
   <form id="contact-form" action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID" method="POST">
   ```
6. **Replace** `YOUR_FORM_ID` with your actual Formspree form ID
   Example: `https://formspree.io/f/xrgkqyzw`

**That's it!** Your contact form will now send emails to: **heetprajapati2401@gmail.com**
